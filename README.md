## Pong

This is a simple game written in Go, using SDL bindings.
It was written based on a tutorial from [here](https://youtu.be/IR5lSa_78uk) plus some additional content done as an exercise:
- Better (imperfect) AI
- Joystick (not only game controllers) support
- Handle collisions with top and the bottom of the screen properly
- Ball slightly increases velocity with each bounce
- The ball bounces differently from a moving paddle or when it hits it's edges

Just compile it for your machine and run. Use space to start the game and arrows/joystick left axis to move the paddle.
